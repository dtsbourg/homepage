After nearly three years building [Claryo](https://claryo.co) from conversations on commutes with Mohamed into a truly awesome AI product, I've decided the time is right for me to step away and begin a new chapter.

Claryo is in great hands. I'm confident our team will keep pushing the mission forward, and I'm excited to cheer them on from the sidelines.

It's been a deeply formative experience: building with brilliant people, solving hard problems, and learning something new every day. To my co-founders, teammates, investors, and friends, thank you for the trust, the energy, and the shared ambition.

What's next? I'm taking a short breather, then diving into some exciting new projects. I have always been fascinated to understand and design systems that perceive, understand and act in the world. Obviously, there is no better time to advance these topics.

Stay tuned, and let's keep in touch. Onward to the next adventure! ðŸ”œâœ¨
