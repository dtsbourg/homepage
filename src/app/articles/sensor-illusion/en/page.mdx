> Would you trust a robot with no sensors? Then why are we building AI agents that way?

In robotics, we obsess over sensors. We use cameras for vision, lidar for depth, IMUs for motion, force sensors for manipulation. Each one is painstakingly selected, calibrated, and fused into a representation of the world — the robot's working reality.

But for **AI agents**, we often treat the data pipeline as an after‑thought, as if the model will fill in the gaps. An agent's *sensor suite* is a tangle of APIs, webhooks, datasets, and user prompts — dynamic, noisy, and sometimes deceptive. Treating that plumbing as an after‑thought is like bolting an uncalibrated camera onto a self‑driving car and hoping the neural net spots the lane markings.

Here's the hard‑earned robotics lesson:

> **Sensor choice drives everything.**

A robot doing warehouse navigation doesn't need the same perception stack as one doing surgical manipulation. The entire architecture — world models, decision logic, planning — is downstream of sensing.

The same applies to AI agents.

An agent doing financial forecasting needs very different inputs than one handling customer support. Yet most are built on generic pipelines and brittle API calls, relying on LLMs to *"figure it out."*

## Robotics Lessons for AI Agent Design

In this case, we could think like roboticists. That means treating inputs as **primary** and models as **downstream**. But unlike robots, AI agents have **two categories** of data sources:

- **Passive sources** – what the model was trained on (pre‑training corpora, embeddings, past interactions). These are priors, not perceptions.
- **Active sources** – real‑time APIs, databases, user prompts, and tools. These are your live sensors—and like any sensor, they can fail, drift, or lie.

So what can we do to improve the situation?

### Part I — Before Deployment: Build for Perception

1.  **Differentiate Priors from Sensors** -- Pre‑training gives your model intuition, not facts. Real‑time perception still matters.

2. **Design for Context Windows, Not Just API Calls** -- Agents don't perceive continuously—they perceive through context windows. Long‑term memory requires explicit design.

3. **Simulate Sensor Failure** -- Test how your agent behaves when data is missing, delayed, or contradictory. For example, [CheckList](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118) and [Robustness Gym](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04840) let you stress‑test model behavior across degraded inputs.

### Part II — During Deployment: Operate Like a Roboticist

4. **Monitor Input Integrity (Sensor Health)** -- Track the quality and freshness of inputs—not just the accuracy of outputs.

5. **Score and Weight Your Sources (Sensor Fusion)** -- LLMs blend inputs naturally, but you should make source confidence explicit. For example, [Toolformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04761) assigns utility to each tool, while the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) pattern conditions reasoning on weighted context.

6. **Build Redundancy & Degradation Paths** -- What happens when an API fails? Fall back to cached knowledge or ask the user. For example, [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) and [Plan‑and‑Execute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17000) agents include recovery steps; [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph/) lets you design stateful agents with explicit fallback flows.



## Tune the whole system

An AI agent is only as smart as the data it perceives. **Don't just tune the model — design the perception pipeline.** Separate pre‑training from real‑time inputs. Monitor them like sensors, fuse them with intent, and build fallback plans when they fail.

Robots taught us that perception drives intelligence. It's time agents learned that too.

> **How do we trust implicit fusion?**


Foundation models transform brittle parsers into probabilistic *polymaths* — they can interpolate across malformed or partial inputs the way a human infers missing words in a sentence. This **model‑free sensor fusion** is messy, probabilistic, and surprisingly robust, but it blurs the provenance of information and hides uncertainty.


Robotics offers structured calibration routines and explicit uncertainty modeling. LLMs offer confident prose. In a next post, we will investigate how modern AI can borrow from such formalisms to improve reliability.
